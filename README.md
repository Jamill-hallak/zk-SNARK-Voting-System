# zk-SNARK-Voting-System
This project demonstrates a secure and private voting system using zk-SNARKs. The system allows voters to cast their votes without revealing their choices, ensuring privacy and preventing double voting. The project will use Circom to create the voting circuit and SnarkJS to generate and verify proofs.
